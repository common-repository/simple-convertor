Simple Converter allows you to easily convert ingredients to and from common volume measurements (cups and millilitres) to weight (grams and ounces).

== Description ==

Simple Converter is the perfect addition for food and recipe blogs. Add the conversion widget to your site's sidebar and instantly enable visitors to convert common ingredient measurements to and from volume and weight.

Simple and lightweight, the widget will perform the calculation directly in your sidebar - no external calls to data-sources required, which makes the converter lightning fast.

If you have any suggestions as to additional ingredients which should be added, or any other general ideas about how I can improve the plugin, please visit the [plugin site](http://www.fiveeurofood.com/index.php/simple-converter/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the simple-converter zip file. To keep things tidy, create a folder called "simple-converter" in the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory and unzip the plugin file into this folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. From the 'Appearance > Widgets' menu, drag the widget "Simple Converter" to a sidebar of your choice. Configure the required options and save it.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Your plugin doesn't have [this ingredient] listed... can you add it? =
Absolutely! Please let me know which ingredients you'd like added by leaving a comment here or at the [plugin site](http://www.fiveeurofood.com/index.php/simple-converter/).

= Your conversion rate is off for [this ingredient]! =
Sorry, please let me know which one is inaccurate and I'll get it fixed right away!

= Can I change the style of the plugin? =
Absolutely - you can do this by adjusting the styles in the two HTML files in the plugin (widget.html and widgetwl.html). The place where you should begin and end editing is clearly indicated. I do plan to add some configuration options directly from the widget options at a later date though.
